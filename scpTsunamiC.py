ABOUT

-----
Brief
  Python script for distributing large files over a cluster.

------------
Requirements
  Unix environment and basic tools (scp, split)
  You will also need to setup ssh keys so you don't have to enter your
    password for every connection.
  You will also need enough disk space (2 times file size).

-------
Summary
  This script improves upon the previous version (scpWave) by splitting 
  the file to transfer into chunks, similar to bitTorrent. A single host
  starts with the file and splits it into chunks. From there, this initial
  host begins sending out the chunks to target machines. Once a target
  receives a chunk, it may then transfer that chunk to other hosts. This 
  happens until all available hosts have all chunks. Hosts will rebuld the
  file as soon as all the chunks are received. Chunks will be removed as
  soon as all calls to 'cat' exit

------------------------
Platform Specific Issues
  1. scpTsunami relies on a certain format for the split command's 
     output. Has created problems on some machines.
  2. I have noticed that some machines have different versions of rcp.
     If you choose to use rcp, modify RCP_CMD_TEMPLATE with the full
     path to the rcp you want to use.

-----------
Usage Notes
  Example usage to transfer image.zip to hosts listed in a file:
    ./scpTsunami image.zip images/image.zip -f hosts.txt
    This is the most basic usage. There are several options to control the
    behavior.
    
    To remove chunks for a file:
      ./scpTsunami clean <file> -f <hostfile>
      This will remove any chunks created earlier while transferring <file>.
      <file> will be preserved.

--------
Behavior
    By default, scp will be used to transfer the files. You can also use rsync
    or rcp. Rsync will only transfer chunks if the file does not already 
    exist on the target host. It does this by comparing the checksums.
    You may use the -p switch to allow chunks to persist on machines 
    and use rsync to keep the chunks updated. This is nice if the transfers
    get interrupted and you need to restart the process.

    See _help() below or run './scpTsunami -h' to see available options.
  
    
================================================================================
DEVELOPMENT NOTES

-----
To do
  1. what to do if host is up but transfers are still failing? Implement
       maximum consecutive transfer failures.

---------------------
Ideas for Performance
  - best chunk size? less than 20M seems much slower. ideal
    appears to be around 25 - 60M
  - playing around with max_transfers_per_host to maximize bandwidth.
  - have hosts favor certain chunks to keep them in memory
  - could check if complete file already exists on the target and not transfer to
    that host. Could still use as a seed, though.
  - random seed, chunk selection
    right now, random seed is selected in getTransfer() and chunk list is
    created randomly. could make it random chunk selection, maybe.
  - class TransferQueue, similar to CommandQueue but for scp calls.
    This would reduce the number of threads.

------
To Fix
  1. output from 'split' not consistent on some machines 
     Getting index error with attempting to split the output lines.
  2. transferring files smaller than chunk size - fixed?

------
Issues
1. multiple versions of rcp on some machines, having trouble using it.
2. heavy CPU usage, it's being plastered. getTransfer() is the likely culprit.
   Need to find a way to find target,seed,chunk tuples w/o checking all 
   possibilities.

Usage
 Transfer a file
 ./scpTsunami.py <file> <filedest> [-s][-v] [-u <username>] [-f <hostfile>]
                 [-l '<host1> <host2> ...'] [-r 'basehost[0-1,4-6,...]']
 Remove chunks from a previously transferred <file>
 ./scpTsunami.py clean <file> [-u <username>] [-f <hostfile>]
                 [-l '<host1> <host2> ...'] [-r 'basehost[0-1,4-6,...]']'''

def _help():
    print '''\
Arguments
  If the first argument is 'clean', scpTsunami will attempt to remove chunks
  from a prior transfer of the filename given as the second argument. Else,
  scpTsunami will attempt to transfer the filename given as argument one to
  the path specified in the second argument to all hosts.

Mandatory options - must use at least 1
  -l '<host1> <host2>' ...     list of hosts to receive the file
  -f <hosts file>              '\\n' separated list of hosts
  -r '<basehost[a-b,c-d,...]>' specify a hostname prefix and a
                               range of numerical suffixes

Other options
  -b    chunk size in bytes, see -b option in unix "split" utility
  -h    help
  -s    log transfer statistics
  -u    specify a username to use
  -v    enable verbose output
  -t    specify maximum number of concurrent transfers per host
  -p    allow chunks to persist on target machines (disables clean up)
 
  --rsync     use rsync to transfer or update files based on checksum
  --scp       use scp to transfer files
  --rcp       use rcp to transfer files
  --chunkdir  specify directory for storing chunks on all hosts
  --help      display this message
  --logfile   where to write log information

Also Note that the default location for the chunks to be stored during the transfer
is in /tmp.  This may not work for really large files.  Make sure to change the
CHUNK_DIR directory to an existing one that has both read and write access for the 
user that has at least the capacity to hold the file.'''
