README for scpTsunami

==================================
files included in this repository:

*NOTE - scpTsunamiC.py is currently the best version.

scpTsunami.py
This is the original version of the script, used for measuring improvements
made in newer versions. Only modifications to this file are to fix bugs.

scpTsunamiA.py
This is a stable, improved version of scpTsunami.py.

scpTsunamiB.py
This version adds improvements to scpTsunamiA.py.

scpTsunamiC.py
This version compensates for the changed output format of
split found in more modern distro's like Ubuntu 15.04.
Based on scpTsunamiB.py.

scpTsunamiE.py
'E' for experimental. This is where new ideas are tested.
Currently, this version polls the scp processes instead of creating a
thread to wait for each process to finish. Version B is much quicker but
it uses more threads.

verify.py
Simple script that compares md5 of local file to the transferred file on
each target host.

====
todo

The algorithm for matching seeds and targets uses a lot of CPU and should
be improved. I have been able to reduce CPU utilization with the current
algorithm but it is still a hog.

changes made in later versions that should be implemented in all:
1) dicts for Host.chunks_owned
2) rm_cmd_template, " instead of '?
3) check target for open slots too!
4) remove roothost name from targetlist
